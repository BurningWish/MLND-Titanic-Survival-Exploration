# Titanic Survival Exploration
This is the 1st project for the Machine Learning Nanodegree Program. Based on the RMS Titanic Passengers Manifest, several prediction models are developed to predict whether a passenger would survive or not based the features of that passenger (for example, sex, age, etc...).

## Code Usage
- First download the repository to your desktop and unzip it.
- Open the ```titanic_survival_exploration.html``` in your browser, where model development results are showned in a HTML file.
- Alternatively, you can ```titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb``` in your Jupyter, to re-run the cells (where necessary data and scripts are also included).
